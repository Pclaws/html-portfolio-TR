 <h1>The Best Movies According to Phinees</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr />

 <h2>Twilight</h2>
 <p>Young adult readers, vampire fans or romance readers will all find Twilight to be an appealing story.
     For a Young Adult novel the book is quite long but don't let that put you off reading it because each page is to be savoured. 
     Believe me, this is one book that you won't want to end.

 <h2>Terminator </h2>
 <p>
    Really cool sci-fi movie.
    2029, a Dystopian future where machines run the world (I can't help wondering if this film got it spot on,) a powerful cyborg killing machine is sent back to 1980 on a mission to kill Sarah Connor.

 <h2>Star wars </h2>
 <p>unreal and verry advance.</p>
